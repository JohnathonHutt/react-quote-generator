This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Built for the freeCodeCamp front-end libraries certificate - this project fetches and displays random quotes from an API (via  http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/random.json quote API) with the option to share them on twitter.
